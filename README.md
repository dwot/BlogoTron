# Blog-o-Tron

This is an experimental OpenAI interface to Wordpress.
It provides a web interface and uses OpenAI GPT3.5 and Dall-E to generate blog posts.
It is inspired by https://github.com/unitythemaker/BlogoMatic which I started pulling apart to experiment with OpenAI 
APIs.

## Configuration

- Configure the prompts, the feed URLs and etc. in
[`config.yml`](config.yml)
- Configure the secrets such as OpenAI token in
[`.env`](.env)
